# taboo

A Go library that orchestrates AI coding agents inside Canonical **workshop**
environments. Each agent gets an isolated, reproducible dev sandbox, and its
commits land back on the host git repository.

taboo is to [workshop](../workshop) roughly what
[sandcastle](../sandcastle) is to Docker/Firecracker: a thin orchestration layer
that handles sandbox lifecycle, the agent's working directory, agent invocation,
and result capture. The difference is the substrate. taboo builds on workshop's
LXD-backed, SDK-driven environments instead of containers/microVMs, and is
written in Go instead of TypeScript.

## What it does

For each agent run, taboo:

1. Creates a git **worktree** on the host (one per run, for isolation).
2. **Bind-mounts** that worktree into a workshop at a fixed path (`/workspace`).
3. **Execs** the agent CLI inside the workshop, streaming its output.
4. Lets the agent commit *in place* — because the worktree is a bind-mount, the
   commits land directly on the host worktree's branch. No extraction step.

Parallel agents each get their own (worktree + workshop) pair, so they never
touch each other's files.

## Core design decisions

These are settled. Each links to the reasoning in
[Open questions & risks](#open-questions--risks-to-verify) where verification is
still pending.

### Integration: shell out to the `workshop` snap CLI

taboo drives workshop by invoking the `workshop` binary installed by its snap. It
does **not** import workshop's Go `client/` package, and does **not** speak the
REST socket directly.

Rationale:

- **No compile-time dependency on a private repo.** taboo's only runtime
  dependency is "the `workshop` snap is installed." This lets taboo be
  open-sourced independently of workshop's visibility.
- **The CLI is the most stable, documented contract** workshop offers (it
  auto-generates CLI reference docs). It is *more* stable than the raw REST
  socket, not less.
- **Decoupled release trains.** taboo follows workshop's published CLI, nothing
  internal.

The load-bearing command is `workshop exec`, which provides everything an agent
runner needs: live stdout/stderr streaming over websockets, TTY/interactive mode,
exit-code and signal forwarding, and `--cwd` / `--env` / `--uid` / `--gid` /
`--timeout` flags.

> **Snap-confinement caveat:** if taboo itself ships as a *strictly*-confined
> snap, calling another snap's binary requires the right interface. If taboo is a
> plain binary or classic-confined (like workshop), this is a non-issue.

### Interface: library-first

The primary deliverable is a Go module (`pkg/taboo`). The audience is engineers
building agent pipelines in Go, who want to express fan-out, review loops, and
custom orchestration in code. A CLI may follow but is not the primary contract.

### Working directory & results: bind-mount, commit in place

workshop has no file-copy primitive, but it does have writable **bind-mounts**
via `remount`. taboo uses this instead of sandcastle's copy-in / extract-commits
model:

- The worktree lives on the host and is bind-mounted into the workshop.
- The agent commits inside it; commits are immediately on the host.
- No sync machinery, no `copyOut`, no `git bundle` tricks for the main flow.

This sidesteps workshop's missing copy primitive entirely and matches its grain.

**Two mounts are required, not one (verified — risk #1).** A *linked* git
worktree is **not self-contained**: its `.git` is a pointer to the main repo's
`.git/worktrees/<name>`, and its objects/refs live in the main `.git`. Mounting
only the worktree's working dir yields `fatal: not a git repository` inside. So
taboo bind-mounts **both**:

1. the worktree → a fixed target (`/workspace`);
2. the repo's main `.git` (the git *common dir*) → mounted at its **identical
   host absolute path** inside the workshop.

Mounting `.git` at the same absolute path makes the worktree's `.git` pointer
resolve identically inside and on the host, so **no pointer rewriting** is needed
and the worktree stays valid on *both* sides. (Rewriting the pointer to a fixed
in-workshop path like `/gitcommon` also lets the commit succeed, but it breaks
the worktree for host-side git — rejected.) Implication: the git-common mount's
`workshop-target` is **per-repo** (it equals the host `.git` path), so it is
templated into `workshop.yaml` per repo, not fixed. This couples a persistent
workshop to one repo unless all managed repos live under a single host parent
that is mounted at its identical path. Revisit this when persistent-reuse-across-repos
is built.

**Mount-plug mechanics (verified — risk #2).** A `mount` plug is declared
**inline in `workshop.yaml`** under any SDK entry (`plugs: { <name>: { interface:
mount, workshop-target: <path> } }`) — no custom mount-SDK needs authoring; it
auto-connects to `system:mount` and gets a default host source, which `remount`
then repoints. taboo owns this `workshop.yaml` template. Two `remount` caveats:

- `remount` is atomic **only** when the new source is empty / non-existent and on
  the same filesystem as the current source. A worktree is non-empty, so the
  per-run swap is **`stop → remount → start`**, not a live swap. It takes seconds,
  not the minutes a launch costs.
- Adding a new plug to a running workshop requires a `refresh`.
- **Mount targets must not resolve to a volatile tmpfs inside the workshop.** A
  target under `/run` *or* `/tmp` silently fails to mount. Because the
  git-common target equals the host `.git` path, **the managed repo must live at
  a non-`/tmp` host path** (e.g. under `$HOME`); a repo under `/tmp` makes the
  worktree's `.git` pointer unresolvable inside (`fatal: not a git repository`).
  VERIFIED — this exact failure surfaced when the integration test used
  `t.TempDir()` (a `/tmp` path) and disappeared once the repo moved under `$HOME`.

The command form is `workshop remount <ws>/<sdk>:<plug> <host-source-path>`.
The `<sdk>` segment is the **bare** SDK name (`opencode`), not the
`project-`-prefixed reference used in the definition's `sdks:` list.

### Execution model: persistent workshop, one per concurrent agent

A workshop is expensive to stand up (LXD container + SDK install, minutes),
unlike a cheap ephemeral sandbox. So:

- **Default:** launch/reuse a *long-lived* workshop, and create a fresh worktree
  per run, remounting it for each run. The expensive launch is amortized across
  many sequential runs.
- **Parallelism:** for N concurrent agents, stand up N workshops, each with its
  own worktree. Isolation is at the workshop level. Reuse across waves keeps the
  cost down; workshop's ZFS snapshot/clone may make warm clones cheap (to be
  measured).

### Agent provisioning: agent-as-SDK

The agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc.) must exist inside the workshop
before taboo can exec it. taboo packages/requires each supported agent as a
**workshop SDK**, and its templated `workshop.yaml` declares the agent SDK
alongside the worktree-mount SDK. SDKs are workshop's native, versioned,
store-sourced dependency mechanism.

**Why agent-as-SDK and not runtime install — VERIFIED (spike).** A workshop's
rootfs changes made by `exec` (e.g. `apt-get install nodejs`, `npm i -g
opencode-ai`) **persist across plain `exec` calls but are wiped by `refresh` and
by `stop`** — they reprovision the rootfs from the declared SDKs. Since the
per-run loop is `stop → remount → start` (the worktree swap above), any
ad-hoc-installed agent would be erased before it ran. The agent therefore *must*
be baked in via an SDK (or otherwise survive reprovisioning), not installed at
runtime. Only bind-mounts (worktree, git-common, sessions, secrets) survive a
`stop`/`refresh`. *(The spike proved the agent path end-to-end by installing
OpenCode immediately after the final `start`, with no further `stop`/`refresh`;
that is a spike shortcut, not the product shape. The product ships an agent
SDK.)*

**Confirmed agent (spike):** OpenCode (`opencode run -m <provider/model>`,
non-interactive) driving `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder-plus` scaffolded taboo's own
Go module and committed it onto the host branch through the bind-mount. OpenCode
authenticates from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the env alone (no `auth login`). Two
operational notes: opencode's auto-title feature makes a side call to a small
model (failed harmlessly under an OpenRouter privacy-policy guardrail without
blocking the run), and qwen occasionally emits a malformed tool call that opencode
rejects and retries. Neither blocked completion.

### Agent auth: env at exec time, never persisted

Credentials (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and equivalents) are read from the host
environment / keyring and passed per run via `workshop exec --env`. They are
never written into `workshop.yaml` or baked into an image; they live only for the
duration of the exec.

### Session capture: redirect storage to a mounted dir

For session resume/fork, agent session files (normally in `$HOME` inside the
workshop, e.g. `~/.claude/projects/...`) must reach the host — but there is no
`copyOut`. taboo mounts a host sessions directory at a known path (a second mount
plug) and points each agent's session storage there via env (e.g.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or the agent's equivalent). Files write straight through to
the host using the same bind-mount trick as the worktree.

## Feature scope

The **full sandcastle feature set is the target spec**, built iteratively. See
[Build order](#build-order). The target features:

- Iteration loop (`maxIterations`) with completion-signal early stop
- Schema-validated structured output extraction
- Session capture + resume/fork
- Lifecycle hooks
- Prompt templating (variable substitution + shell expansion)
- Parallel fan-out (caller-driven)

## Build order

Tracer-bullet first. The walking skeleton proves the entire risk surface before
any feature work.

1. ✅ **Walking skeleton — PROVEN (CLI spike).** Templated a `workshop.yaml`
   (`go` SDK + inline mounts) → launch → host worktree → `stop`/`remount`/`start`
   → `exec` OpenCode (qwen3-coder-plus via OpenRouter) → it scaffolded taboo's own
   Go module and its commit landed on the host `agent/go-skeleton` branch, owned
   by the host uid, building cleanly. Proved UID write-through, the two-mount
   git-worktree requirement, inline mount plugs, env-only agent auth, and the
   rootfs-reprovisioning constraint that forces agent-as-SDK. **Now rebuilt as the
   real Go library `pkg/taboo`** (deep `Runner.Run`, `Commander` seam, embedded
   agent SDK), test-first: 17 unit tests on a fake `Commander`, plus a build-tagged
   integration test (`go test -tags integration`) that runs the whole path against
   real workshop: a deterministic shell agent's commit lands on the host branch.
   A second integration test exercises the real OpenCode agent when
   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set.
2. **Iteration loop + completion-signal** early stop.
3. **Structured output extraction.** Go equivalent of sandcastle's Zod —
   **resolved (ADR 0002): generics over `encoding/json`, the caller's struct is
   the schema.** A `ResultExtractor` parses the last `<result>{...}</result>`
   block from the agent's final output and `JSONResult[T]` decodes it into `T`;
   `Validator` + `WithStrictFields()` add opt-in validation; no new dependency.
4. **Parallel fan-out.** N workshops, worktree-per-agent, caller-driven
   concurrency. **Sessions constraint:** the host sessions dir is
   `<ProjectDir>/sessions`, shared by every run in a ProjectDir, so concurrent
   runs must not share one — give each its own ProjectDir (or a per-slot
   sessions subdir), else they share OpenCode's single SQLite store and can
   corrupt it.
5. **Session capture** (✅ done) **+ resume/fork** (deferred) via the mounted
   sessions dir.
6. **Hooks + prompt templating** ergonomics.

## Open questions & risks (to verify)

Ordered by risk. Items 1–2 are the highest-risk assumptions and are exactly what
the walking skeleton (build step 1) exists to prove.

1. ✅ **UID idmap write-through — VERIFIED (CLI spike).** Host worktree owned by
   host uid 10000 appears as `workshop:workshop (1000:1000)` inside and is
   writable; files written inside land on the host owned by **10000** (correct).
   The LXD idmap is bidirectional. A linked-worktree commit made inside (as uid
   1000) landed directly on the host repo's branch — commit-in-place confirmed.
   *Caveat surfaced: requires the two-mount design above (worktree + main `.git`
   at identical host path), not a single worktree mount.*
2. ✅ **Mount plug AND agent SDK — BOTH VERIFIED (Go `pkg/taboo`).** A `mount`
   plug declared inline under an SDK entry launches and remounts correctly; the
   `stop → remount → start` swap and the same-filesystem atomic-remount rule are
   confirmed. The **agent SDK is now resolved**: OpenCode is baked via an
   **in-project SDK** authored with `workshop sketch-sdk … --eject --name opencode`
   (lives at `.workshop/opencode/`: `sdk.yaml` + `hooks/setup-base`). Its
   `setup-base` hook installs OpenCode (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install |
   bash`, then copies the binary to `/usr/local/bin`). taboo ships these files
   embedded (`//go:embed sdk`) and seeds them into each managed project dir.
   - **In-project SDK naming:** referenced as **`project-opencode`** in the
     definition's `sdks:` list; workshop resolves it to the bare **`opencode`**
     used for the `remount <ws>/opencode:<plug>` qualifier and in `info`.
   - **Survives the per-run loop (the whole point of agent-as-SDK):** the baked
     binary is still present after `stop → start`. Measured: **stop ≈ 2 s, start
     ≈ 3.6 s**. The per-run swap really is seconds, as assumed.
3. **Configurable session/home path.** Session redirect depends on each agent
   honoring a configurable session/home location (e.g. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).
   Verify per agent.
   - ✅ **OpenCode — VERIFIED (docs).** OpenCode resolves its data dir from
     `XDG_DATA_HOME` (via `xdg-basedir`); sessions live under
     `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/project/<project-slug>/storage/` (default
     `~/.local/share/opencode/`). Setting `XDG_DATA_HOME` to the mounted host
     dir redirects session storage through the bind-mount. **Caveat for the
     sessions slice:** OpenCode stores sessions in a **SQLite DB** (`OPENCODE_DB`,
     the "channel db"), not loose JSONL like Claude/Codex. Write-through over a
     bind-mount is fine, but resume/fork semantics over a DB are harder than
     file-copy — almost certainly why sandcastle leaves OpenCode non-resumable.
     The `AgentProfile.Sessions()` accessor returns `({XDG_DATA_HOME, "opencode"},
     true)` for OpenCode. **Capture is now built (risk #3 closed for OpenCode):**
     `renderDefinition` adds a `sessions` mount plug, `Runner.Setup` binds a host
     sessions dir into the swap, and `Runner.Exec` sets `XDG_DATA_HOME` to the
     mount target so session files write through to the host and survive the
     stop/remount/start swap — verified end-to-end by the OpenCode integration
     test. Resume/fork over the SQLite DB (the DB-vs-JSONL question) remains
     deferred to a later slice.
4. **Table-parsing fragility.** `list` / `changes` / `tasks` emit human tables
   (no JSON). Prefer `info` / `actions` (real YAML) and minimize reliance on
   table output; watch for breakage across workshop versions.

## Deferred design decisions

Not workshop-specific; follow sandcastle's proven design when reached:

- **Branch-naming convention** — head / merge-to-head / named-branch strategies.
- ~~**Go structured-output mechanism**~~ — resolved in ADR 0002 (generics over
  `encoding/json`; the struct is the schema).

## Glossary

- **workshop** — Canonical's tool for ephemeral, declaratively-defined LXD dev
  environments. taboo's substrate.
- **SDK** — workshop's unit of installed dependency (versioned, store-sourced).
  taboo ships agents and the worktree mount as SDKs.
- **plug / slot** — workshop's connection model (snap-like). A `mount` plug with
  a `workshop-target` is how a host path is bound into a workshop.
- **remount** — the `workshop` CLI command that points an existing mount plug at
  a new host source path. taboo uses it to attach a worktree.
- **worktree** — a host git worktree, one per agent run, bind-mounted into a
  workshop as the agent's working directory.
- **sandcastle** — the TypeScript reference product taboo is modeled on.
- **AgentProfile** — taboo's per-agent abstraction (mirrors sandcastle's
  *AgentProvider*; renamed *Profile* in taboo). One value fully describes an
  agent: how to build its exec argv from a prompt (`BuildCommand`), which host
  env vars carry its credentials (`CredentialEnvKeys`, passed `--env NAME`,
  value inherited never persisted), how to redirect its session storage onto a
  mounted host dir (`Sessions` → env var + on-disk subpath), and the name of the
  workshop **SDK** that bakes its CLI in (`Name`, which doubles as the SDK
  qualifier). The model is baked in at construction (`OpenCode(model)`). `Config`
  references one `AgentProfile` instead of a raw agent command. OpenCode is the
  first concrete profile.
- **agent registry** — the lookup in `pkg/taboo` that resolves a canonical agent
  name (with a model) to its **AgentProfile**, and enumerates the canonical names
  taboo supports. The name it keys on is one identity with `AgentProfile.Name()`
  and the workshop **SDK** qualifier — a single canonical string per agent, no
  separate registry alias. The CLI consults the enumerated names to suggest a
  correction on an unknown name; the fuzzy matching itself lives in the CLI, not
  the registry.
- **result block** — a delimited span in the agent's output (default
  `<result>…</result>`) whose JSON payload is the run's structured result. The
  agent is prompted to emit one; the **last** one in the final iteration's output
  is authoritative.
- **ResultExtractor** — taboo's structured-output abstraction (sandcastle's
  Zod-shaped concern, done the Go way; ADR 0002). A pure function over the
  agent's captured output that finds the result block and decodes/validates its
  payload into a typed value. Constructed by `JSONResult[T]`; surfaced on an
  orchestrated run as `OrchestratedResult.Result` (typed `any`). Distinguishes
  *no block* (`ErrNoResult`) from *block found but invalid* (`ErrInvalidResult`).
